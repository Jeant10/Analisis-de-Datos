       "<br/>He is with us live via satellite\n",

       "<br/>Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows\n",
       "the familiar stories of Titanic.\n",
       "<br/>You know, the nobility of the\n",

       "<br/>But what I'm interested in are the untold stories.\n",
       "The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.\n",

       "<br/>Well, nobody ever called the\n",

       "<br/>What is it?\n",
       "<br/>Turn that up, dear.\n",
       "<br/>I have museum-trained experts\n",
       "sent out here making sure...\n",
       "<br/>---that these relics are preserved\n",
       "and catalogued properly.\n",
       "<br/>Take a look at this drawing\n",
       "that we found just today.\n",
       "<br/>A piece of paper that's been underwater\n",
       "for 84 years.\n",
       "<br/>And my team are able to\n",

       "<br/>Should this have remained unseen\n",

       "<br/>I'll be goddamned.\n",
       "<br/>Brock!\n",
       "<br/>There's a satellite call for you.\n",
       "<br/>Bobby, we're launching. You see\n",

       "<br/>Trust me, buddy.\n",
       "You want to take this call.\n",
       "<br/>This better be good.\n",
       "<br/>Now, you gotta speak up.\n",
       "She's kind of old.\n",
       "<br/>Great.\n",
       "<br/>This is Brock Lovett.\n",
       "How can I help you, Mrs...?\n",
       "<br/>Calvert. Rose Calvert.\n",
       "<br/>Mrs. Calvert.\n",
       "<br/>I was just wondering if you had found...\n",
       "<br/>...the \"Heart of the Ocean\" yet, Mr. Lovett.\n",
       "<br/>Told you you wanted to take the call.\n",
       "<br/>All right, you have my\n",
       "attention, Rose.\n",
       "<br/>Can you tell us who the woman\n",
       "in the picture is?\n",
       "<br/>Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.\n",
       "<br/>She's a goddamn liar!\n",
       "Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.\n",
       "<br/>God only knows why.\n",
       "Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.\n",
       "<br/>They're inbound!\n",
       "<br/>Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the\n",
       "Titanic when she was 17, right?\n",
       "<br/>- That's right.\n",
       "- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.\n",
       "<br/>101 next month.\n",
       "<br/>Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.\n",
       "<br/>Look, I've already done the\n",
       "background on this woman...\n",
       "<br/>...all the way back to the 20s,\n",
       "when she was working as an actress.\n",
       "<br/>An actress.\n",
       "There's your first clue, Sherlock.\n",
       "<br/>Her name was Rose Dawson back then.\n",
       "Then she marries this guy named Calvert.\n",
       "<br/>They move to Cedar Rapids\n",
       "and she punches out a couple of kids.\n",
       "<br/>Now Calvert's dead\n",
       "and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.\n",
       "<br/>And everybody who knows about the\n",
       "diamond is supposed to be dead...\n",
       "<br/>...or on this boat,\n",
       "but she knows.\n",
       "<br/>Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?\n",
       "<br/>Hurry up, give him a hand.\n",
       "<br/>Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.\n",
       "Welcome to the Keldysh.\n",
       "<br/>Okay, let's get her inside there.\n",
       "<br/>Hi, Miss Calvert.\n",
       "<br/>- Hi.\n",
       "- Welcome to the Keldysh.\n",
       "<br/>Thanks.\n",
       "<br/>Hey!\n",
       "<br/>Are your staterooms\n",
       "all right?\n",
       "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
       "<br/>Very nice.\n",
       "<br/>Have you met my\n",
       "granddaughter, Lizzy?\n",
       "<br/>She takes care of me.\n",
       "<br/>We met just a few\n",
       "minutes ago.\n",
       "<br/>Remember, Nana?\n",
       "Up on deck?\n",
       "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
       "<br/>There. That's nice.\n",
       "<br/>Have to have my\n",
       "pictures when I travel.\n",
       "<br/>Can I get you anything?\n",
       "<br/>Is there anything you'd like?\n",
       "<br/>Yes.\n",
       "<br/>I would like to\n",
       "see my drawing.\n",
       "<br/>Louis XVI wore a fabulous\n",
       "stone that was...\n",
       "<br/>...called the Blue Diamond\n",
       "of the Crown...\n",
       "<br/>...which disappeared\n",
       "in 1792...\n",
       "<br/>...about the same time old Louis lost\n",
       "everything from the neck up.\n",
       "<br/>The theory goes that the\n",
       "crown diamond was chopped, too.\n",
       "<br/>Recut into a heart-like shape that\n",
       "became known as...\n",
       "<br/>...the Heart of the Ocean.\n",
       "<br/>Today it would be worth\n",
       "more than the Hope diamond.\n",
       "<br/>It was a dreadful,\n",
       "heavy thing.\n",
       "<br/>I only wore it this once.\n",
       "<br/>You actually think\n",
       "this is you, Nana?\n",
       "<br/>It is me, dear.\n",
       "<br/>Wasn't I a dish?\n",
       "<br/>I tracked it down\n",
       "through insurance records.\n",
       "<br/>An old claim that was settled\n",
       "under terms of absolute secrecy.\n",
       "<br/>Can you tell me who the\n",
       "claimant was, Rose?\n",
       "<br/>I should imagine someone\n",
       "named Hockley.\n",
       "<br/>Nathan Hockley,\n",
       "that's right.\n",
       "<br/>Pittsburgh steel tycoon.\n",
       "<br/>The claim was for a\n",
       "diamond necklace his son...\n",
       "<br/>...Caledon, bought his fiancée.\n",
       "<br/>You.\n",
       "<br/>A week before he\n",
       "sailed on Titanic.\n",
       "<br/>And it was filed right\n",
       "after the sinking.\n",
       "<br/>So the diamond had to have\n",
       "gone down with the ship.\n",
       "<br/>You see the date?\n",
       "<br/>April 14, 1912\n",
       "<br/>Which means if your grandmother\n",
       "is who she says she is...\n",
       "<br/>...she was wearing the diamond\n",
       "the day the Titanic sank.\n",
       "<br/>And that makes you\n",
       "my new best friend.\n",
       "<br/>These are some of the things\n",
       "we recovered from your stateroom.\n",
       "<br/>This was mine.\n",
       "<br/>How extraordinary.\n",
       "<br/>And it looks the same as it\n",
       "did the last time I saw it.\n",
       "<br/>The reflection has\n",
       "changed a bit.\n",
       "<br/>Are you ready to go\n",
       "back to Titanic?\n",
       "<br/>Okay, here we go.\n",
       "<br/>She hits the berg on\n",
       "the starboard side, right?\n",
       "<br/>She kind of bumps along...\n",
       "<br/>...punching holes like\n",
       "morse code...\n",
       "<br/>-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...\n",
       "<br/>...below the waterline.\n",
       "<br/>Then the forward compartments\n",
       "start to flood.\n",
       "<br/>Now, as the water\n",
       "level rises...\n",
       "<br/>...it spills over the\n",
       "watertight bulkheads...\n",
       "<br/>which, unfortunately, don't go\n",
       "any higher than E deck-\n",
       "<br/>So now as the\n",
       "bow goes down...\n",
       "<br/>...the stern rises up,\n",
       "slow at first...\n",
       "<br/>...then faster and faster...\n",
       "<br/>...until finally, she's got her whole\n",
       "ass sticking up in the air.\n",
       "<br/>And that's a big ass.\n",
       "<br/>We're talking\n",
       "20, 30,000 tons. Okay?\n",
       "<br/>And the hull's not designed\n",
       "to deal with that pressure.\n",
       "<br/>So, what happens?\n",
       "<br/>She splits, right\n",
       "down to the keel.\n",
       "<br/>And the stern...\n",
       "<br/>...falls back level.\n",
       "<br/>Then...\n",
       "<br/>...as the bow sinks...\n",
       "<br/>...it pulls the stern vertical...\n",
       "<br/>...and then finally detaches.\n",
       "<br/>Now the stern section just kind of bobs\n",
       "there like a cork for a couple of minutes...\n",
       "<br/>...floods, and finally goes\n",
       "under about 2:20 AM...\n",
       "<br/>...2 hours and 40 minutes\n",
       "after the collision.\n",
       "<br/>The bow section\n",
       "planes away...\n",
       "<br/>...landing about a\n",
       "half a mile away...\n",
       "<br/>...going 20, 30 knots when\n",
       "it hits the ocean floor.\n",
       "<br/>Pretty cool, huh?\n",
       "<br/>Thank you for that fine\n",
       "forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.\n",
       "<br/>Of course, the\n",
       "experience of it was...\n",
       "<br/>...somewhat different.\n",
       "<br/>Will you share it with us?\n",
       "<br/>I'm taking her to rest.\n",
       "<br/>No.\n",
       "<br/>Come on, Nana.\n",
       "<br/>No!\n",
       "<br/>Give me the\n",
       "tape recorder.\n",
       "<br/>Tell us, Rose.\n",
       "<br/>It's been 84 years--\n",
       "<br/>It's okay. Just try\n",
       "to remember anything...\n",
       "<br/>...anything at all.\n",
       "<br/>Do you want to hear this\n",
       "or not, Mr. Lovett?\n",

       "for what you did.\n",
       "<br/>Not just for pulling me back,\n",
       "but for your discretion.\n",
       "<br/>You're welcome.\n",
       "<br/>Look.\n",
       "<br/>I know what you\n",
       "must be thinking.\n",
       "<br/>Poor little rich girl.\n",
       "<br/>What does she know about misery?\n",
       "<br/>No.\n",
       "<br/>No, that's not what I was thinking.\n",
       "<br/>What I was thinking was...\n",
       "<br/>---what could have happened to this girl\n",
       "to make her think she had no way out?\n",
       "<br/>Well I...\n",
       "<br/>It was everything.\n",
       "It was my whole world and...\n",
       "<br/>...all the people in it.\n",
       "<br/>And the inertia of my life,\n",
       "plunging ahead and me...\n",
       "<br/>...powerless to stop it.\n",
       "<br/>God,\n",
       "look at that thing.\n",
       "<br/>You would have gone\n",
       "straight to the bottom.\n",
       "<br/>500 invitations have gone out.\n",
       "<br/>All of Philadelphia society will be there.\n",
       "<br/>And all the while I feel I'm...\n",
       "<br/>...standing in the middle\n",
       "of a crowded room...\n",
       "<br/>...screaming at the\n",
       "top of my lungs...\n",
       "<br/>...and no one\n",
       "even looks up.\n",
       "<br/>Do you love him?\n",
       "<br/>Pardon me?\n",
       "<br/>Do you love him?\n",
       "<br/>You're being very rude. You\n",
       "shouldn't be asking me this.\n",
       "<br/>Well, it's a simple question.\n",
       "Do you love the guy or not?\n",
       "<br/>This is not a suitable conversation.\n",
       "<br/>VVhy can't you just\n",
       "answer the question?\n",
       "<br/>This is absurd.\n",
       "<br/>You don't know me\n",
       "and I don't know you...\n",
       "<br/>...and we are not having this\n",
       "conversation at all. You are rude...\n",
       "<br/>...and uncouth and presumptuous\n",
       "and I am leaving now...\n",
       "<br/>...Jack. Mr. Dawson.\n",
       "It's been a pleasure.\n",
       "<br/>I sought you out to thank you\n",
       "and now I have thanked you.\n",
       "<br/>And you've insulted me.\n",
       "<br/>Well, you deserved it.\n",
       "<br/>- Right.\n",
       "- Right.\n",
       "<br/>I thought you were leaving.\n",
       "<br/>I am.\n",
       "<br/>You are so annoying.\n",
       "<br/>Wait.\n",
       "<br/>I don't have to leave. This is\n",
       "my part of the ship. You leave.\n",
       "<br/>Well, well, well.\n",
       "Now who's being rude?\n",
       "<br/>What is this stupid thing\n",
       "you're carrying around?\n",
       "<br/>So, what are you,\n",
       "an artist or something?\n",
       "<br/>These are rather good.\n",
       "<br/>They're very good, actually.\n",
       "<br/>Jack, this is exquisite work.\n",
       "<br/>Ah, they didn't think too\n",
       "much of them in old Paree.\n",
       "<br/>Paris?\n",
       "<br/>You do get around\n",
       "for a p--\n",
       "<br/>Well, a-- a\n",
       "person of limited means.\n",
       "<br/>Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.\n",
       "<br/>Well, well, well.\n",
       "<br/>And these were drawn from life?\n",
       "<br/>Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.\n",
       "<br/>Lots of girls are willing\n",
       "to take their clothes off.\n",
       "<br/>You liked this woman.\n",
       "<br/>You used her several times.\n",
       "<br/>Well.\n",
       "<br/>She had beautiful\n",
       "hands, you see?\n",
       "<br/>I think you must have\n",
       "had a love affair with her.\n",
       "<br/>No, no, no.\n",
       "Just with her hands.\n",
       "<br/>She was a\n",
       "one-legged prostitute.\n",
       "<br/>See?\n",
       "<br/>She had a good\n",
       "sense of humor though.\n",
       "<br/>Oh, and this lady...\n",
       "<br/>She used to sit at this bar every night...\n",
       "<br/>...wearing every piece\n",
       "of jewelry she owned...\n",
       "<br/>...just waiting for\n",
       "her long, lost love.\n",
       "<br/>We called her Madame Bijoux.\n",
       "<br/>See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.\n",
       "<br/>Well,\n",
       "you have a gift, Jack.\n",
       "<br/>You do.\n",
       "<br/>You see people.\n",
       "<br/>I see you.\n",
       "<br/>And?\n",
       "<br/>You wouldn't have jumped.\n",
       "<br/>But the purpose of university\n",
       "is to find a suitable husband.\n",
       "<br/>Rose has already done that.\n",
       "<br/>Look, here comes that\n",
       "vulgar Brown woman.\n",
       "<br/>Quickly, get up before\n",
       "she sits with us.\n",
       "<br/>Hello, girls. I was hoping\n",
       "I'd catch you at tea.\n",
       "<br/>We're awfully sorry,\n",
       "you missed it.\n",
       "<br/>The Countess and I were just\n",
       "off to take the air on the boat deck.\n",
       "<br/>What a lovely idea.\n",
       "I need to catch up on my gossip.\n",
       "<br/>Countess.\n",
       "<br/>So, you've not yet lit the\n",
       "last four boilers?\n",
       "<br/>No, I don't see\n",
       "the need.\n",
       "<br/>We are making excellent time.\n",
       "<br/>The press knows the size of Titanic.\n",
       "Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.\n",
       "<br/>We must give them\n",
       "something new to print.\n",
       "<br/>This maiden voyage\n",
       "of Titanic must...\n",
       "<br/>...make headlines.\n",
       "<br/>Mr. lsmay, I would prefer\n",
       "not to push the engines...\n",
       "<br/>...until they've been properly run in.\n",
       "<br/>Of course I'm just a passenger.\n",
       "<br/>I leave it to your good offices\n",
       "to decide what's best.\n",
       "<br/>But what a glorious end to your final crossing...\n",
       "<br/>...if we were to get into New York\n",
       "on Tuesday night...\n",
       "<br/>...and surprise them all.\n",
       "Make the morning papers.\n",
       "<br/>Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?\n",
       "<br/>Good man.\n",
       "<br/>After that, I worked\n",
       "on a squid boat in Monterey...\n",
       "<br/>...then I went to Los Angeles to the...\n",
       "<br/>...Santa Monica pier\n",
       "and did portraits for 10 cents each.\n",
       "<br/>Why can't I be like you?\n",
       "<br/>Just head out for the horizon\n",
       "whenever I feel like it.\n",
       "<br/>Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...\n",
       "<br/>only if we just talk about it\n",
       "<br/>No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.\n",
       "<br/>Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up\n",
       "<br/>We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.\n",
       "<br/>But you have to do it like a real cowboy.\n",
       "No sidesaddle stuff.\n",
       "<br/>You mean with one leg on each side?\n",
       "<br/>Can you show me?\n",
       "<br/>Sure, if you like.\n",
       "<br/>Teach me to ride like a man.\n",
       "<br/>Chew tobacco like a man.\n",
       "<br/>And spit like a man.\n",
       "<br/>You didn't learn in finishing school?\n",
       "<br/>No.\n",
       "<br/>Come on, I'll show you.\n",
       "<br/>I'll show you how.\n",
       "<br/>Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.\n",
       "<br/>I couldn't possibly, Jack.\n",
       "<br/>Watch closely.\n",
       "<br/>That's disgusting.\n",
       "<br/>Your turn\n",
       "<br/>That was pitiful.\n",
       "You really have to hawk it back.\n",
       "<br/>Get some leverage.\n",
       "Use your arms. Arc your neck.\n",
       "<br/>You see the range on that thing?\n",
       "<br/>Okay, go.\n",
       "<br/>That was better. You have to work on it.\n",
       "Really try to hawk it up.\n",
       "<br/>Mother.\n",
       "<br/>May I introduce Jack Dawson?\n",
       "<br/>Charmed, I'm sure.\n",
       "<br/>The others were gracious and curious\n",
       "about the man who'd saved my life.\n",
       "<br/>But my mother looked at him like an insect.\n",
       "<br/>A dangerous insect\n",
       "which must be squashed quickly.\n",
       "<br/>Sounds like you're a good man\n",
       "to have around in a sticky spot.\n",
       "<br/>Why do they always insist on announcing\n",
       "dinner like a damn cavalry charge?\n",
       "<br/>Shall we go dress, Mother?\n",
       "<br/>See you at dinner, Jack.\n",
       "<br/>Uh, son?\n",
       "<br/>Son!\n",
       "<br/>Do you have any idea what you're doing?\n",
       "<br/>Not really.\n",
       "<br/>You're about to go into the snake pit.\n",
       "<br/>What are you going to wear?\n",
       "<br/>I figured. Come on.\n",
       "<br/>I was right. You and my son\n",
       "are just about the same size.\n",
       "<br/>Pretty close.\n",
       "<br/>You shine up like a new penny.\n",
       "<br/>Good evening, sir.\n",
       "<br/>Thousands of tons of Hockley steel\n",
       "are in this ship.\n",
       "<br/>- Which part?\n",
       "- All the right ones.\n",
       "<br/>Then you're accountable\n",
       "if there's a problem. Where's Rose?\n",
       "<br/>She'll be along.\n",
       "<br/>There is the Countess.\n",
       "<br/>I saw that in a nickelodeon\n",
       "and always wanted to do it.\n",
       "<br/>Darling...\n",
       "<br/>...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.\n",
       "<br/>It's amazing.\n",
       "You could almost pass for a gentleman.\n",
       "<br/>Almost.\n",
       "<br/>This is extraordinary.\n",
       "<br/>This is a remarkable voyage.\n",
       "<br/>- Mad.\n",
       "- Completely lunatic.\n",
       "<br/>There's the Countess of Rothes.\n",
       "<br/>That's John Jacob Astor...\n",
       "<br/>...the richest man on board.\n",
       "<br/>His little wifey, Madeleine,\n",
       "is my age and in a delicate condition.\n",
       "<br/>See how she tries to hide it.\n",
       "<br/>Quite the scandal.\n",
       "<br/>Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,\n",
       "Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...\n",
       "<br/>...is at home with the children, of course.\n",
       "And over here...\n",
       "<br/>...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon.\n",
       "<br/>She designs naughty lingerie,\n",
       "among her many talents.\n",
       "<br/>Very popular with the royals.\n",
       "<br/>Congratulations. She's splendid.\n",
       "<br/>Why, thank you.\n",
       "<br/>Escort a lady to dinner?\n",
       "<br/>Certainly.\n",
       "<br/>Sweet pea, sweet pea.\n",
       "<br/>Ain't nothing to it.\n",
       "<br/>They love money. Pretend like you own\n",
       "a gold mine and you're in the club.\n",
       "<br/>Hey, Astor.\n",
       "<br/>Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.\n",
       "<br/>J.J., Madeleine,\n",
       "I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.\n",
       "<br/>Well, Jack...\n",
       "<br/>...are you of the Boston Dawsons?\n",
       "<br/>No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.\n",
       "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
       "<br/>He must have been nervous,\n",
       "but he never faltered.\n",
       "<br/>They assumed he was one of them.\n",
       "<br/>Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.\n",
       "<br/>New money, obviously,\n",
       "but still a member of the club.\n",
       "<br/>Mother, of course,\n",
       "could always be counted upon.\n",
       "<br/>Tell us of the accommodations in steerage\n",
       "Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good-\n",
       "<br/>The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.\n",
       "<br/>Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.\n",
       "<br/>He was of help to my fiancée last night.\n",
       "<br/>It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.\n",
       "<br/>He showed me some of his work today.\n",
       "<br/>Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.\n",
       "Not to impugn your work, sir.\n",
       "<br/>Are all these mine?\n",
       "<br/>Start from the outside and work in.\n",
       "<br/>He knows every rivet in her.\n",
       "<br/>Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.\n",
       "<br/>Thank you, Rose.\n",
       "<br/>How do you take your caviar, sir?\n",
       "<br/>No caviar for me, thanks.\n",
       "Never did like it much.\n",
       "<br/>Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?\n",
       "<br/>Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.\n",
       "<br/>After that, I'm on God's good humor.\n",
       "<br/>How do you have means to travel?\n",
       "<br/>I work my way from place to place.\n",
       "Tramp steamers and such.\n",
       "<br/>I won my ticket on Titanic\n",
       "at a lucky hand at poker.\n",
       "<br/>A very lucky hand.\n",
       "<br/>All life is a game of luck.\n",
       "<br/>A real man makes his own luck.\n",
       "Right, Dawson?\n",
       "<br/>And you find\n",
       "that sort of rootless existence appealing?\n",
       "<br/>Yes, ma'am, I do.\n",
       "<br/>I've got everything I need\n",
       "right here with me.\n",
       "<br/>I have air in my lungs\n",
       "and blank sheets of paper.\n",
       "<br/>I love waking up, not knowing\n",
       "what will happen or who I'll meet.\n",
       "<br/>Where I'll wind up.\n",
       "<br/>One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...\n",
       "<br/>...now I'm on the grandest ship\n",
       "in the world, with you fine people.\n",
       "<br/>I'll take more of that.\n",
       "<br/>Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.\n",
       "<br/>You never know what hand you'll get dealt.\n",
       "<br/>You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.\n",
       "<br/>Make each day count.\n",
       "<br/>Well said, Jack.\n",
       "<br/>Hear, hear.\n",
       "<br/>To making it count.\n",
       "<br/>To making it count.\n",
       "<br/>Bravo.\n",
       "<br/>But Mr. Brown didn't know\n",
       "I'd hidden the money in the stove.\n",
       "<br/>He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating\n",
       "and lights a fire.\n",
       "<br/>Next is brandy in the smoking room.\n",
       "<br/>Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?\n",
       "<br/>Now they retreat to congratulate each\n",
       "other on being masters of the universe.\n",
       "<br/>Ladies, thank you for your company.\n",
       "<br/>May I escort you to the cabin?\n",
       "<br/>No, I'll stay here.\n",
       "<br/>Here, Molly.\n",
       "<br/>Joining us, Dawson?\n",
       "<br/>You don't want to stay with the women.\n",
       "<br/>No, thanks. I have to head back.\n",
       "<br/>That's best. It'll be all business and politics.\n",
       "Wouldn't interest you.\n",
       "<br/>But Dawson, good of you to come.\n",
       "<br/>Must you go?\n",
       "<br/>Time for me to row with the other slaves.\n",
       "<br/>Good night, Rose.\n",
       "<br/>Want to go to a real party?\n",
       "<br/>Is okay I put my hand here?\n",
       "<br/>I can't understand you.\n",
       "<br/>I'm going to dance with her now.\n",
       "<br/>Come on.\n",
       "<br/>Come on. Come with me.\n",
       "<br/>Jack. Jack, wait.\n",
       "<br/>I can't do this.\n",
       "<br/>We'll have to get a bit closer.\n",
       "<br/>Like this.\n",
       "<br/>You're still my best girl, Cora.\n",
       "<br/>- I don't know the steps.\n",
       "- Me, either. Just go with it.\n",
       "<br/>Don't think.\n",
       "<br/>Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!\n",
       "<br/>Wh at? Wait!\n",
       "<br/>Jack, no.\n",
       "<br/>--Beyond the jurisdiction\n",
       "of the Sherman Act.\n",
       "<br/>That's what Rockefeller said--\n",
       "Supreme Court didn't swallow it.\n",
       "<br/>What? You think\n",
       "a first-class girl can't drink?\n",
       "<br/>Get out of here.\n",
       "<br/>Are you all right?\n",
       "<br/>I'm fine.\n",
       "<br/>Two out of three.\n",
       "<br/>So...\n",
       "<br/>...you think you're tough?\n",
       "<br/>Let's see you do this.\n",
       "<br/>Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.\n",
       "<br/>Jesus!\n",
       "<br/>You okay?\n",
       "<br/>I haven't done that in years.\n",
       "<br/>Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.\n",
       "<br/>Coffee, sir?\n",
       "<br/>You didn't come to me last night.\n",
       "<br/>I was tired.\n",
       "<br/>Your exertions below deck\n",
       "were no doubt exhausting.\n",
       "<br/>I see you had\n",
       "that undertaker of a manservant follow me.\n",
       "<br/>You will never behave like that again.\n",
       "<br/>I'm not one of your mill foremen\n",
       "who you can command.\n",
       "<br/>I'm your fiancée.\n",
       "<br/>My fiancée. My fiancée!\n",
       "<br/>Yes, you are! And my wife!\n",
       "<br/>My wife in practice,\n",
       "if not yet by law, so you will honor me!\n",
       "<br/>You will honor me the way\n",
       "a wife honors her husband.\n",
       "<br/>Because I will not be made a fool of.\n",
       "<br/>Is this in any way unclear?\n",
       "<br/>No.\n",
       "<br/>Good. Excuse me.\n",
       "<br/>Oh, Miss Rose.\n",
       "<br/>We had a little accident.\n",
       "<br/>- That's all right.\n",
       "- I'm sorry.\n",
       "<br/>Let me help you.\n",
       "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
       "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",
       "<br/>Tea, Trudy.\n",
       "<br/>You're not to see that boy again.\n",
       "You understand?\n",
       "<br/>Rose, I forbid it.\n",
       "<br/>Stop it, Mother.\n",

       "<br/>Now, you gotta speak up.\n",
       "She's kind of old.\n",

       "<br/>Mrs. Calvert.\n",
       "<br/>I was just wondering if you had found...\n",
       "<br/>...the \"Heart of the Ocean\" yet, Mr. Lovett.\n",
       "<br/>Told you you wanted to take the call.\n",
       "<br/>All right, you have my\n",

       "<br/>Can you tell us who the woman\n",

       "<br/>Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.\n",
       "<br/>She's a goddamn liar!\n",
       "Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.\n",
       "<br/>God only knows why.\n",

       "<br/>They're inbound!\n",
       "<br/>Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the\n",
       "Titanic when she was 17, right?\n",
       "<br/>- That's right.\n",
       "- If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now.\n",
       "<br/>101 next month.\n",
       "<br/>Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.\n",
       "<br/>Look, I've already done the\n",
       "background on this woman...\n",
       "<br/>...all the way back to the 20s,\n",
       "when she was working as an actress.\n",
       "<br/>An actress.\n",
       "There's your first clue, Sherlock.\n",
       "<br/>Her name was Rose Dawson back then.\n",
       "Then she marries this guy named Calvert.\n",
       "<br/>They move to Cedar Rapids\n",
       "and she punches out a couple of kids.\n",
       "<br/>Now Calvert's dead\n",
       "and, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.\n",
       "<br/>And everybody who knows about the\n",

       "Up on deck?\n",
       "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
       "<br/>There. That's nice.\n",
       "<br/>Have to have my\n",

       "<br/>Can I get you anything?\n",
       "<br/>Is there anything you'd like?\n",
       "<br/>Yes.\n",
       "<br/>I would like to\n",
       "see my drawing.\n",
       "<br/>Louis XVI wore a fabulous\n",
       "stone that was...\n",
       "<br/>...called the Blue Diamond\n",
       "of the Crown...\n",
       "<br/>...which disappeared\n",
       "in 1792...\n",
       "<br/>...about the same time old Louis lost\n",
       "everything from the neck up.\n",
       "<br/>The theory goes that the\n",
       "crown diamond was chopped, too.\n",
       "<br/>Recut into a heart-like shape that\n",
       "became known as...\n",
       "<br/>...the Heart of the Ocean.\n",
       "<br/>Today it would be worth\n",
       "more than the Hope diamond.\n",
       "<br/>It was a dreadful,\n",
       "heavy thing.\n",
       "<br/>I only wore it this once.\n",
       "<br/>You actually think\n",
       "this is you, Nana?\n",
       "<br/>It is me, dear.\n",
       "<br/>Wasn't I a dish?\n",
       "<br/>I tracked it down\n",
       "through insurance records.\n",
       "<br/>An old claim that was settled\n",
       "under terms of absolute secrecy.\n",
       "<br/>Can you tell me who the\n",
       "claimant was, Rose?\n",
       "<br/>I should imagine someone\n",
       "named Hockley.\n",
       "<br/>Nathan Hockley,\n",
       "that's right.\n",
       "<br/>Pittsburgh steel tycoon.\n",
       "<br/>The claim was for a\n",
       "diamond necklace his son...\n",
       "<br/>...Caledon, bought his fiancée.\n",
       "<br/>You.\n",
       "<br/>A week before he\n",
       "sailed on Titanic.\n",
       "<br/>And it was filed right\n",
       "after the sinking.\n",
       "<br/>So the diamond had to have\n",
       "gone down with the ship.\n",
       "<br/>You see the date?\n",
       "<br/>April 14, 1912\n",
       "<br/>Which means if your grandmother\n",
       "is who she says she is...\n",
       "<br/>...she was wearing the diamond\n",
       "the day the Titanic sank.\n",
       "<br/>And that makes you\n",
       "my new best friend.\n",
       "<br/>These are some of the things\n",
       "we recovered from your stateroom.\n",
       "<br/>This was mine.\n",
       "<br/>How extraordinary.\n",
       "<br/>And it looks the same as it\n",
       "did the last time I saw it.\n",
       "<br/>The reflection has\n",
       "changed a bit.\n",
       "<br/>Are you ready to go\n",
       "back to Titanic?\n",
       "<br/>Okay, here we go.\n",
       "<br/>She hits the berg on\n",
       "the starboard side, right?\n",
       "<br/>She kind of bumps along...\n",
       "<br/>...punching holes like\n",
       "morse code...\n",
       "<br/>-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...\n",
       "<br/>...below the waterline.\n",
       "<br/>Then the forward compartments\n",
       "start to flood.\n",
       "<br/>Now, as the water\n",
       "level rises...\n",
       "<br/>...it spills over the\n",
       "watertight bulkheads...\n",
       "<br/>which, unfortunately, don't go\n",
       "any higher than E deck-\n",
       "<br/>So now as the\n",
       "bow goes down...\n",
       "<br/>...the stern rises up,\n",
       "slow at first...\n",
       "<br/>...then faster and faster...\n",
       "<br/>...until finally, she's got her whole\n",
       "ass sticking up in the air.\n",
       "<br/>And that's a big ass.\n",
       "<br/>We're talking\n",
       "20, 30,000 tons. Okay?\n",
       "<br/>And the hull's not designed\n",
       "to deal with that pressure.\n",
       "<br/>So, what happens?\n",
       "<br/>She splits, right\n",
       "down to the keel.\n",
       "<br/>And the stern...\n",
       "<br/>...falls back level.\n",
       "<br/>Then...\n",
       "<br/>...as the bow sinks...\n",
       "<br/>...it pulls the stern vertical...\n",
       "<br/>...and then finally detaches.\n",
       "<br/>Now the stern section just kind of bobs\n",
       "there like a cork for a couple of minutes...\n",
       "<br/>...floods, and finally goes\n",
       "under about 2:20 AM...\n",
       "<br/>...2 hours and 40 minutes\n",
       "after the collision.\n",
       "<br/>The bow section\n",
       "planes away...\n",
       "<br/>...landing about a\n",
       "half a mile away...\n",
       "<br/>...going 20, 30 knots when\n",
       "it hits the ocean floor.\n",
       "<br/>Pretty cool, huh?\n",
       "<br/>Thank you for that fine\n",
       "forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.\n",
       "<br/>Of course, the\n",
       "experience of it was...\n",
       "<br/>...somewhat different.\n",
       "<br/>Will you share it with us?\n",
       "<br/>I'm taking her to rest.\n",
       "<br/>No.\n",
       "<br/>Come on, Nana.\n",
       "<br/>No!\n",
       "<br/>Give me the\n",
       "tape recorder.\n",
       "<br/>Tell us, Rose.\n",
       "<br/>It's been 84 years--\n",
       "<br/>It's okay. Just try\n",
       "to remember anything...\n",
       "<br/>...anything at all.\n",
       "<br/>Do you want to hear this\n",
       "or not, Mr. Lovett?\n",

       "<br/>Well, that's one of the good things about Paris.\n",
       "<br/>Lots of girls are willing\n",

       "<br/>You liked this woman.\n",
       "<br/>You used her several times.\n",
       "<br/>Well.\n",

       "<br/>She was a\n",

       "<br/>See?\n",
       "<br/>She had a good\n",

       "<br/>Good man.\n",
       "<br/>After that, I worked\n",

       "<br/>...then I went to Los Angeles to the...\n",

       "<br/>Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier...\n",
       "<br/>only if we just talk about it\n",
       "<br/>No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.\n",
       "<br/>Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up\n",

       "<br/>Sounds like you're a good man\n",

       "<br/>You're about to go into the snake pit.\n",
       "<br/>What are you going to wear?\n",
       "<br/>I figured. Come on.\n",
       "<br/>I was right. You and my son\n",
       "are just about the same size.\n",
       "<br/>Pretty close.\n",
       "<br/>You shine up like a new penny.\n",
       "<br/>Good evening, sir.\n",
       "<br/>Thousands of tons of Hockley steel\n",
       "are in this ship.\n",
       "<br/>- Which part?\n",
       "- All the right ones.\n",
       "<br/>Then you're accountable\n",
       "if there's a problem. Where's Rose?\n",
       "<br/>She'll be along.\n",
       "<br/>There is the Countess.\n",
       "<br/>I saw that in a nickelodeon\n",

       "<br/>Darling...\n",
       "<br/>...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.\n",
       "<br/>It's amazing.\n",
       "You could almost pass for a gentleman.\n",
       "<br/>Almost.\n",
       "<br/>This is extraordinary.\n",
       "<br/>This is a remarkable voyage.\n",
       "<br/>- Mad.\n",
       "- Completely lunatic.\n",
       "<br/>There's the Countess of Rothes.\n",
       "<br/>That's John Jacob Astor...\n",
       "<br/>...the richest man on board.\n",
       "<br/>His little wifey, Madeleine,\n",

       "<br/>Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,\n",
       "Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...\n",

       "<br/>Sweet pea, sweet pea.\n",
       "<br/>Ain't nothing to it.\n",
       "<br/>They love money. Pretend like you own\n",

       "<br/>Hey, Astor.\n",
       "<br/>Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.\n",
       "<br/>J.J., Madeleine,\n",
       "I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.\n",
       "<br/>Well, Jack...\n",
       "<br/>...are you of the Boston Dawsons?\n",
       "<br/>No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.\n",
       "<br/>Oh, yes.\n",
       "<br/>He must have been nervous,\n",
       "but he never faltered.\n",
       "<br/>They assumed he was one of them.\n",
       "<br/>Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.\n",
       "<br/>New money, obviously,\n",
       "but still a member of the club.\n",
       "<br/>Mother, of course,\n",
       "could always be counted upon.\n",
       "<br/>Tell us of the accommodations in steerage\n",
       "Mr- Dawson- I hear they're quite good-\n",
       "<br/>The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.\n",
       "<br/>Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.\n",
       "<br/>He was of help to my fiancée last night.\n",
       "<br/>It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist.\n",
       "<br/>He showed me some of his work today.\n",
       "<br/>Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.\n",
       "Not to impugn your work, sir.\n",
       "<br/>Are all these mine?\n",
       "<br/>Start from the outside and work in.\n",
       "<br/>He knows every rivet in her.\n",
       "<br/>Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.\n",
       "<br/>Thank you, Rose.\n",
       "<br/>How do you take your caviar, sir?\n",
       "<br/>No caviar for me, thanks.\n",
       "Never did like it much.\n",
       "<br/>Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?\n",
       "<br/>Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.\n",
       "<br/>After that, I'm on God's good humor.\n",
       "<br/>How do you have means to travel?\n",
       "<br/>I work my way from place to place.\n",
       "Tramp steamers and such.\n",
       "<br/>I won my ticket on Titanic\n",
       "at a lucky hand at poker.\n",
       "<br/>A very lucky hand.\n",
       "<br/>All life is a game of luck.\n",
       "<br/>A real man makes his own luck.\n",
       "Right, Dawson?\n",
       "<br/>And you find\n",
       "that sort of rootless existence appealing?\n",
       "<br/>Yes, ma'am, I do.\n",
       "<br/>I've got everything I need\n",
       "right here with me.\n",
       "<br/>I have air in my lungs\n",
       "and blank sheets of paper.\n",
       "<br/>I love waking up, not knowing\n",
       "what will happen or who I'll meet.\n",
       "<br/>Where I'll wind up.\n",
       "<br/>One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...\n",
       "<br/>...now I'm on the grandest ship\n",
       "in the world, with you fine people.\n",
       "<br/>I'll take more of that.\n",
       "<br/>Life's a gift. I don't intend on wasting it.\n",
       "<br/>You never know what hand you'll get dealt.\n",
       "<br/>You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal.\n",
       "<br/>Make each day count.\n",
       "<br/>Well said, Jack.\n",
       "<br/>Hear, hear.\n",
       "<br/>To making it count.\n",
       "<br/>To making it count.\n",
       "<br/>Bravo.\n",
       "<br/>But Mr. Brown didn't know\n",
       "I'd hidden the money in the stove.\n",
       "<br/>He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating\n",
       "and lights a fire.\n",
       "<br/>Next is brandy in the smoking room.\n",
       "<br/>Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?\n",
       "<br/>Now they retreat to congratulate each\n",
       "other on being masters of the universe.\n",
       "<br/>Ladies, thank you for your company.\n",
       "<br/>May I escort you to the cabin?\n",
       "<br/>No, I'll stay here.\n",
       "<br/>Here, Molly.\n",
       "<br/>Joining us, Dawson?\n",
       "<br/>You don't want to stay with the women.\n",
       "<br/>No, thanks. I have to head back.\n",
       "<br/>That's best. It'll be all business and politics.\n",
       "Wouldn't interest you.\n",
       "<br/>But Dawson, good of you to come.\n",
       "<br/>Must you go?\n",
       "<br/>Time for me to row with the other slaves.\n",
       "<br/>Good night, Rose.\n",
       "<br/>Want to go to a real party?\n",
       "<br/>Is okay I put my hand here?\n",
       "<br/>I can't understand you.\n",
       "<br/>I'm going to dance with her now.\n",
       "<br/>Come on.\n",
       "<br/>Come on. Come with me.\n",
       "<br/>Jack. Jack, wait.\n",
       "<br/>I can't do this.\n",
       "<br/>We'll have to get a bit closer.\n",
       "<br/>Like this.\n",
       "<br/>You're still my best girl, Cora.\n",
       "<br/>- I don't know the steps.\n",
       "- Me, either. Just go with it.\n",
       "<br/>Don't think.\n",
       "<br/>Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!\n",
       "<br/>Wh at? Wait!\n",
       "<br/>Jack, no.\n",
       "<br/>--Beyond the jurisdiction\n",
       "of the Sherman Act.\n",
       "<br/>That's what Rockefeller said--\n",

       "<br/>What? You think\n",
       "a first-class girl can't drink?\n",
       "<br/>Get out of here.\n",
       "<br/>Are you all right?\n",
       "<br/>I'm fine.\n",
       "<br/>Two out of three.\n",
       "<br/>So...\n",
       "<br/>...you think you're tough?\n",
       "<br/>Let's see you do this.\n",
       "<br/>Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.\n",
       "<br/>Jesus!\n",
       "<br/>You okay?\n",
       "<br/>I haven't done that in years.\n",
       "<br/>Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let's go.\n",
       "<br/>Coffee, sir?\n",
       "<br/>You didn't come to me last night.\n",
       "<br/>I was tired.\n",
       "<br/>Your exertions below deck\n",
       "were no doubt exhausting.\n",
       "<br/>I see you had\n",

       "<br/>You will never behave like that again.\n",
       "<br/>I'm not one of your mill foremen\n",
       "who you can command.\n",
       "<br/>I'm your fiancée.\n",
       "<br/>My fiancée. My fiancée!\n",
       "<br/>Yes, you are! And my wife!\n",
       "<br/>My wife in practice,\n",

       "<br/>Because I will not be made a fool of.\n",
       "<br/>Is this in any way unclear?\n",
       "<br/>No.\n",
       "<br/>Good. Excuse me.\n",
       "<br/>Oh, Miss Rose.\n",
       "<br/>We had a little accident.\n",
       "<br/>- That's all right.\n",
       "- I'm sorry.\n",
       "<br/>Let me help you.\n",
       "<br/>It's all right, miss.\n",

       "<br/>Of course I know.\n",
       "You remind me every day.\n",
       "<br/>Your father left us nothing but a legacy\n",

That\\'s nice.\\nHave to have my\\npictures when I travel.\\nCan I get you anything?\\nIs there anything you\\'d like?\\nYes.\\nI would like to\\nsee my drawing.\\nLouis XVI wore a fabulous\\nstone that was...\\n...called the Blue Diamond\\nof the Crown...\\n...which disappeared\\nin 1792...\\n...about the same time old Louis lost\\neverything from the neck up.\\nThe theory goes that the\\ncrown diamond was chopped, too.\\nRecut into a heart-like shape that\\nbecame known as...\\n...the Heart of the Ocean.\\nToday it would be worth\\nmore than the Hope diamond.\\nIt was a dreadful,\\nheavy thing.\\nI only wore it this once.\\nYou actually think\\nthis is you, Nana?\\nIt is me, dear.\\nWasn\\'t I a dish?\\nI tracked it down\\nthrough insurance records.\\nAn old claim that was settled\\nunder terms of absolute secrecy.\\nCan you tell me who the\\nclaimant was, Rose?\\nI should imagine someone\\nnamed Hockley.\\nNathan Hockley,\\nthat\\'s right.\\nPittsburgh steel tycoon.\\nThe claim was for a\\ndiamond necklace his son...\\n...Caledon, bought his fiancée.\\nYou.\\nA week before he\\nsailed on Titanic.\\nAnd it was filed right\\nafter the sinking.\\nSo the diamond had to have\\ngone down with the ship.\\nYou see the date?\\nApril 14, 1912\\nWhich means if your grandmother\\nis who she says she is...\\n...she was wearing the diamond\\nthe day the Titanic sank.\\nAnd that makes you\\nmy new best friend.\\nThese are some of the things\\nwe recovered from your stateroom.\\nThis was mine.\\nHow extraordinary.\\nAnd it looks the same as it\\ndid the last time I saw it.\\nThe reflection has\\nchanged a bit.\\nAre you ready to go\\nback to Titanic?\\nOkay, here we go.\\nShe hits the berg on\\nthe starboard side, right?\\nShe kind of bumps along...\\n...punching holes like\\nmorse code...\\n-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...\\n...below the waterline.\\nThen the forward compartments\\nstart to flood.\\nNow, as the water\\nlevel rises...\\n...it spills over the\\nwatertight bulkheads...\\nwhich, unfortunately, don\\'t go\\nany higher than E deck-\\nSo now as the\\nbow goes down...\\n...the stern rises up,\\nslow at first...\\n...then faster and faster...\\n...until finally, she\\'s got her whole\\nass sticking up in the air.\\nAnd that\\'s a big ass.\\nWe\\'re talking\\n20, 30,000 tons. Okay?\\nAnd the hull\\'s not designed\\nto deal with that pressure.\\nSo, what happens?\\nShe splits, right\\ndown to the keel.\\nAnd the stern...\\n...falls back level.\\nThen...\\n...as the bow sinks...\\n...it pulls the stern vertical...\\n...and then finally detaches.\\nNow the stern section just kind of bobs\\nthere like a cork for a couple of minutes...\\n...floods, and finally goes\\nunder about 2:20 AM...\\n...2 hours and 40 minutes\\nafter the collision.\\nThe bow section\\nplanes away...\\n...landing about a\\nhalf a mile away...\\n...going 20, 30 knots when\\nit hits the ocean floor.\\nPretty cool, huh?\\nThank you for that fine\\nforensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.\\nOf course, the\\nexperience of it was...\\n...somewhat different.\\nWill you share it with us?\\nI\\'m taking her to rest.\\nNo.\\nCome on, Nana.\\nNo!\\nGive me the\\ntape recorder.\\nTell us, Rose.\\nIt\\'s been 84 years--\\nIt\\'s okay. Just try\\nto remember anything...\\n...anything at all.\\nDo you want to hear this\\nor not, Mr. Lovett?\\nIt\\'s been 84 years...\\n...and I can still smell\\nthe fresh paint.\\nThe china had\\nnever been used.\\nThe sheets had\\nnever been slept in.\\nTitanic was called\\nthe ship of dreams.\\nAnd it was.\\nIt really was.\\nAll third-class\\npassengers...\\n...with a forward berth...\\n...this way please!\\nThis queue!\\nIt\\'s a big boat, huh?\\nDaddy, it\\'s a ship.\\nYou\\'re right.\\nI don\\'t see what all\\nthe fuss is about.\\nIt doesn\\'t look any bigger\\nthan the Mauretania.\\nYou can be blasé\\nabout some things, Rose...\\n...but not about Titanic.\\nIt\\'s over 100 feet longer\\nthan Mauretania...\\n...and far more luxurious.\\nYour daughter is far too\\ndifficult to impress, Ruth.\\nSo this is the ship they\\nsay is unsinkable.\\nIt is unsinkable.\\nGod Himself\\ncould not sink this ship--\\nWh at?!\\nYou have to check your baggage\\nthrough the main terminal.\\nIt\\'s round that\\nway, sir.\\nI put my faith in\\nyou good sir.\\nNow kindly\\nsee my man.\\nYes sir.
